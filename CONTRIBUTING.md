Limnie is a project that still has a long way to go before reaching some acceptable level of maturity.\
If you find it useful and want to see it grow, here's what you can do!

## Ways you can contribute (from most important to least)
* Stress-test Limnie\
Integrate Limnie to your business application or use/make a stress-testing application to examine how reliable how reliable Limnie is.

* Create a separate Limnie test/administration application\
Start your own repository with a copy of the Limnie library and create an application that is going to give value to the project.

* Give feedback\
You can provide feedback on how existing methods can be made safer and/or more efficient.\
You can also suggest new methods for the base classes that would implement core functionality that Limnie users (other developers that is) would appreciate.\
Please refrain from making trivial suggestions regarding LimnieGUI (such as UI layout and such).

* Directly contribute code to the main Limnie repository\
When contributing to this project, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owner of this repository before making a change.
Be aware that your code will have to be thoroughly examined and will have to meet certain quality criteria.
